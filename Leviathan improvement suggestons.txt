1. Normalize field name casing across requests and responses

2.Validate phone number and email fields; observed examples of invalid values

3. Standardize credential handling (preferably via HTTP headers)

4. Rename endpoints to pluralized resource names for clarity (e.g. /employees, /customers)

	- POST /employees adds to the collection

	- GET /employees/{id} retrieves a single employee
